        <p class="tab"> Many LOD datasets, such as DBpedia and LinkedGeoData,
are voluminous and process large amounts of requests from diverse applications.
Many data products and services rely on full or partial local
LOD replications to ensure faster querying and processing. While such
replicas enhance the flexibility of information sharing and integration
infrastructures, they also introduce data duplication with all the associated
undesirable consequences. Given the evolving nature of the original
and authoritative datasets, to ensure consistent and up-to-date replicas
frequent replacements are required at a great cost. </p> <p class="tab">
We introduce an approach for interest-based RDF update propagation, which
propagates only interesting parts of updates from the source to the target
dataset. Effectively, this enables remote applications to ‘subscribe’
to relevant datasets and consistently reflect the necessary changes locally
without the need to frequently replace the entire dataset (or a
relevant subset). Our approach is based on a formal definition for graph pattern-based
interest expressions that is used to filter interesting parts
of updates from the source. We implement the approach in the iRap
framework and perform a comprehensive evaluation based on DBpedia
Live updates, to confirm the validity and value of our approach. </p>
