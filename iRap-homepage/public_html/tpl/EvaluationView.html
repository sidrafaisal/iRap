An thorough evaluation of the approach, using large-scale real-world
data dumps and changesets regularly provided by a renowned LOD dataset, indicates
that our method can significantly cut down on both the size of the data
updates required to consistently maintain a localized dataset replication up-to-date,
as well as the speed by which such updates can take place.

<p class="tab">    
    To evaluate the proposed approach, we performed experiments on the iRap
    framework using <a href="http://live.dbpedia.org/changesets/" target="_blank">changesets published by DBpedia</a> and compared the results
with the <a href="https://github.com/dbpedia/dbpedia-live-mirror" target="_blank">DBpedia Live Mirror</a> tool. The comparison considers two cases: using iRap to update a previously-established local replica of i) an entire remote
dataset ii) a subset of a remote dataset. These two cases simulate two ways in which iRap can be used: i) using interest-based changeset propagation for future
updates of a local copy of a large dataset or ii) starting with a new subset of the large dataset.

We set up two target datasets and potentially interesting dataset using Jena
TDB and jena-fuseki for each dataset. The potentially interesting dataset stores
potentially interesting triples for each interest expression within a named graph.
All experiments were carried out on a 64-bit machine with Windows 7, Intel(R)
Core i7-4770 CPU, 16GB RAM and 1TB HD.

We tested our approach using the DBpedia dump for the initial setup of the target datasets for two
different application domains, namely, Location and Football datasets. The evaluation comprises two interest expressions.
Changesets used for evaluation and further evaluation material can be found at iRap's <a href="https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/iRap" target="_blank"> GitHub repository.</a>
