            </p>

<p class="tab">
                 To evaluate the proposed approach, we performed experiments on the iRap
                framework using <a href="http://live.dbpedia.org/changesets/" target="_blank">
                    changesets published by DBpedia</a> and compared the results
                with the <a href="https://github.com/dbpedia/dbpedia-live-mirror" target="_blank">
                    DBpedia Live Mirror</a> tool. 
                The comparison considers two cases: using iRap to update a previously-established 
                local replica of 
            <ul>
                <li>an entire remote dataset
                </li>
                <li>a subset of a remote dataset
                </li>
            </ul>   
</p>   

            <p class="tab"> 
                These two cases simulate two ways in which iRap can be used:
            <ul>
                <li>using interest-based changeset propagation for future
                    updates of a local copy of a large dataset
                </li>
                <li>starting with a new subset of the large dataset.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="tab">
                We set up two target datasets and potentially interesting dataset using Jena
                TDB and jena-fuseki for each dataset. The potentially interesting dataset stores
                potentially interesting triples for each interest expression within a named graph.
                All experiments were carried out on a 64-bit machine with Windows 7, Intel(R)
                Core i7-4770 CPU, 16GB RAM and 1TB HD.
            </p>

            <p class="tab">
                We tested our approach using the DBpedia dump for the initial setup of the target datasets for two
                different application domains, namely, Location and Football datasets. For study purposes, the evaluation material can be found at iRap's <a href="https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/iRap" target="_blank"> GitHub repository.</a>

            </p>
            <p class="tab">
                An thorough evaluation of the approach, using large-scale real-world
                data dumps and changesets regularly provided by a renowned LOD dataset, indicates
                that our method can significantly cut down on both the size of the data
                updates required to consistently maintain a localized dataset replication up-to-date,
                as well as the speed by which such updates can take place.

<br/>Figure 2: Evaluation results for Football dataset.
</p>

<p class="tab">
    Figure 2a shows the number of triples published per day and the number
of interesting triples and potentially interesting triples found from interest
evaluation for Football dataset. Figure 2b shows the dataset growth comparison
between iRap and a full mirror approach. As the figure clearly shows, iRap
managed datasets are almost two orders of magnitude smaller and grow much
slower than with a mirror approach. Note that the growth for each datasets is
calculated by subtracting the number of removed triples from and adding the
number of added triples to the total number of triples in the dataset.
